# CS303Assignment3

The purpose of this program is to implement an Expression Manager with operations such as infix to postfix conversion and balanced parentheses check using data structures and methods from C++.

There are many comments made on all the different types of files which serve as a guide to the thought process and purpose of each implementation within the code. 

There are five files... 
  1. ExpressionManager.h: includes function declarations for the Expression Manager Class
  2. ExpressionManager.cpp: includes function implementations for the Expression Manager Class
  3. Queue.h: includes function queue for the Queue class
  4. Queue.cpp: includes function implementations for the Queue class
  5. main.cpp: seeks user's input, performs actions promptly, and displays the final result

An example of a valid infix expression: (a + b) * c
An example of an invalid infix expression: a + b) * c
Regardless, the code will validate the user's input and will continue to ask for valid input until received

I have included a screenshot, as a file, of an example of an output from the program after running it
